  abstract    = {We consider a problem of considerable practical interest: the recovery of a data matrix from a sampling of its entries. Suppose that we observe m entries selected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and recover the entries that we have not seen? We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of sampled entries obeys m >= C n^{1.2} r log n for some positive numerical constant C, then with very high probability, most n by n matrices of rank r can be perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The condition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of the rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well. Our results are connected with the recent literature on compressed sensing, and show that objects other than signals and images can be perfectly reconstructed from very limited information.},

The use of new search directions is proposed and one additional condition is imposed on the inexact line search. The convergence of the resulting algorithm can be established under standard conditions for a twice continuously differentiable function with a bounded level set. Algorithms based on these modifications have been tested on a number of problems, showing considerable improvements. Comparisons with the BFGS and other quasi-Newton methods are also given.},

abstract = "Is the whole protein surface available for interaction with other proteins, or are specific sites pre-assigned according to their biophysical and structural character? And if so, is it possible to predict the location of the binding site from the surface properties? These questions are answered quantitatively by probing the surfaces of proteins using spheres of radius of 10Å on a database (DB) of 57 unique, non-homologous proteins involved in heteromeric, transient protein–protein interactions for which the structures of both the unbound and bound states were determined. In structural terms, we found the binding site to have a preference for β-sheets and for relatively long non-structured chains, but not for α-helices. Chemically, aromatic side-chains show a clear preference for binding sites. While the hydrophobic and polar content of the interface is similar to the rest of the surface, hydrophobic and polar residues tend to cluster in interfaces. In the crystal, the binding site has more bound water molecules surrounding it, and a lower B-factor already in the unbound protein. The same biophysical properties were found to hold for the unbound and bound DBs. All the significant interface properties were combined into ProMate, an interface prediction program. This was followed by an optimization step to choose the best combination of properties, as many of them are correlated. During optimization and prediction, the tested proteins were not used for data collection, to avoid over-fitting. The prediction algorithm is fully automated, and is used to predict the location of potential binding sites on unbound proteins with known structures. The algorithm is able to successfully predict the location of the interface for about 70% of the proteins. The success rate of the predictor was equal whether applied on the unbound DB or on the disjoint bound DB. A prediction is assumed correct if over half of the predicted continuous interface patch is indeed interface. The ability to predict the location of protein–protein interfaces has far reaching implications both towards our understanding of specificity and kinetics of binding, as well as in assisting in the analysis of the proteome."

    abstract = {Prediction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) sites is one of the most challenging problems in computational biology. Although great progress has been made by employing various machine learning approaches with numerous characteristic features, the problem is still far from being solved. In this study, we developed a novel predictor based on Random Forest (RF) algorithm with the Minimum Redundancy Maximal Relevance (mRMR) method followed by incremental feature selection (IFS). We incorporated features of physicochemical/biochemical properties, sequence conservation, residual disorder, secondary structure and solvent accessibility. We also included five 3D structural features to predict protein-protein interaction sites and achieved an overall accuracy of 0.672997 and MCC of 0.347977. Feature analysis showed that 3D structural features such as Depth Index (DPX) and surface curvature (SC) contributed most to the prediction of protein-protein interaction sites. It was also shown via site-specific feature analysis that the features of individual residues from PPI sites contribute most to the determination of protein-protein interaction sites. It is anticipated that our prediction method will become a useful tool for identifying PPI sites, and that the feature analysis described in this paper will provide useful insights into the mechanisms of interaction.},

abstract={Multidimensional data that occur in a variety of applications in clinical diagnostics and health care can naturally be represented by multidimensional arrays (i.e., tensors). Tensor decompositions offer valuable and powerful tools for latent concept discovery that can handle effectively missing values and noise. We propose a seamless, application-independent feature extraction and multiple-instance (MI) classification method, which represents the raw multidimensional, possibly incomplete, data by means of learning a high-order dictionary. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in two application scenarios: (i) prediction of frailty in older people using multisensor recordings and (ii) breast cancer classification based on histopathology images. The proposed method outperforms or is comparable to the state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning classifiers highlighting its potential for computer-assisted diagnosis and health care support.},
